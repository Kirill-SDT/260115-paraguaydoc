  "summary": "Visual design system and specifications completed. Selected hybrid editorial structure (Fear-First hero + Timeline-First core + Story-Driven trust) to avoid generic layouts. Developed distinctive typography (Crimson Text + Source Sans 3 + JetBrains Mono, NOT Inter/Roboto), warm earthy color palette (terracotta, sage, cream), and asymmetric layouts inspired by Bloomberg/Linear/Stripe. Created complete design system with CSS variables, component library, and section-by-section specifications. All design decisions optimize for trust-building and Russian language support with mobile-first approach (70%+ traffic). Design intentionally avoids all 'AI slop' aesthetics and generic landing page clichés.",
