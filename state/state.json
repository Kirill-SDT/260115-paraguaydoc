CRITICAL: Propose 3 distinct structural alternatives for the landing page that avoid the standard hero-features-pricing model. Consider unconventional approaches such as: (1) Story-driven journey showing the client's transformation from uncertainty to residence, (2) Question-based navigation addressing specific fears upfront, (3) Timeline-first approach showing the process visually before pricing. Segment content strategy for two audiences (families with $5-10k budget vs. entrepreneurs with $70k+ budget). Define trust-building elements and conversion funnel. Create detailed recommendations for designer and frontend developer in separate markdown files."

CRITICAL: Avoid generic landing page structures. NO standard hero/feature grids. NO Inter/Roboto fonts. NO purple gradients. Create an unconventional, editorial-style layout inspired by sources like Bloomberg or Linear.app. The design must feel human and trustworthy, not like a template. Mandatory first deliverable: designer_report_visual_concept.md with 3-5 reference images and visual principles. Choose distinctive typography (consider: Crimson Pro for editorial warmth, JetBrains Mono for transparency/tech credibility, or Clash Display for modern confidence). Design must support Russian language content and accommodate two audience segments. Mobile-first approach required (70%+ mobile traffic expected)."

The page must support Russian language content, work as a static site (no backend), and achieve sub-3-second load times. Implement form submission for lead capture. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, Lighthouse performance score 90+, and cross-browser compatibility. Use BEM naming convention and Mobile-First responsive approach. All code must pass W3C validation. The final deliverable should inspire trust and feel professionally crafted, not template-based."

Recommended hybrid approach combining elements from all three.
