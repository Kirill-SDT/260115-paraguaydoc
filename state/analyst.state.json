  "summary": "Requirements analysis completed. Defined target audience segments (families/$5-10k vs. entrepreneurs/$70k+), developed brand positioning ('reliable friend-lawyer' tone), and proposed 3 distinct structural alternatives that avoid generic hero-features-pricing layouts: (1) Story-Driven Journey, (2) Fear-First/Transparency-Led, (3) Timeline-First/Process Visualization. Recommended hybrid approach combining elements from all three. Created comprehensive content strategy with trust-building framework, conversion funnel, and detailed briefs for Designer and Frontend teams.",
